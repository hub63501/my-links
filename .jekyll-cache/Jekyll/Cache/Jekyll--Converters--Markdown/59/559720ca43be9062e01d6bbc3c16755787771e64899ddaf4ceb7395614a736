I"h<p>Here are five linux apps to try if your a linux user.</p>

<ul>

<li>
1
<a href="https://www.odio.io" target="_blank">
<h3>Odio</h3>
</a>

<p>
A really nice looking application that streams radio stations from around the world. If you've ever tried the mobile app Tunein then this is like the desktop version of that but in my view a whole lot better.
</p>
</li>

<li>2
   <p><a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/#pk_campaign=sd&amp;pk_kwd=features-en-gb" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>: a very underated web browser that keeps on getting better with each update. Also the mobile web browser is'nt bad either and is one browser that still ocupies the top tab function.</p>
</li>
<li>3
   <p><a href="https://hisham.hm/htop/" target="_blank">htop</a>: a good tool for analyzing network traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>4
   <p><a href="https://github.com/calo001/fondo" target="_blank">fondo</a>: Wallpapers for everyone. A program that looks great and makes your desktop look great.</p>
</li>
<li>5
   <p><a href="https://laverna.cc" target="_blank">Laverna</a>: a clean looking note taking app with encryption enabled.</p>
</li>

</ul>
