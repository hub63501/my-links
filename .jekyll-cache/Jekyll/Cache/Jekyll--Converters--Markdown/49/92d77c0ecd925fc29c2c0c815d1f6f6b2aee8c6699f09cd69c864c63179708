<h2>How did TIME Person of the Year come about?</h2>

<p>TIME describes the decision to create a person of the year was purely an accident because of a slow news week they couldn‚Äôt find a person of the week to fit on the front of their cover.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what happened: New Year‚Äôs week of 1928 had been a string of slow news days. In those years, TIME‚Äôs cover ‚Äî which had only recently acquired its signature red border ‚Äî was dedicated almost exclusively to portraiture, but there was nobody whose face seemed to fit the week‚Äôs events. As the publication date approached, the editors were at a loss. ‚ÄúNo one had done anything newsworthy enough to put his picture on TIME‚Äôs cover, so somebody suggested we stop looking for a Man of the Week and pick a Man of the Year,‚Äù wrote then-publisher P.I. Prentice in the Jan. 1, 1945, issue. ‚ÄúThis was an easy choice: Charles Augustus Lindbergh, who had soloed the Atlantic in only 33 hours and 39 minutes, was the hero of 1927.‚Äù (It was also the case that Lindbergh had not been on the cover yet, an oversight that needed rectifying. The week that news of Lindbergh‚Äôs flight was reported, the TIME cover featured an old picture of King George V &amp; Queen Mary in masquerade costumes.)‚Äù</p>

<h2>Why is TIME Person of the Year important?</h2>

<p>Well whether it is important is simply a matter of opinion however it has created a way of summing up the biggest story of world events over the course of the year and has been seen as marks of history.</p>
