What makes a good striker? Is it the strikers who score the most goals? or is it the strikers who bring more to the team and bring others into the equation and overall link up play. Today I'm looking at what a striker is and what is a good striker.

<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

The main objective of a striker is to score the most amount of goals and the teams objective is to create as many opportunities for the striker to score those goals so with this simple definition we can analyse who has scored the most goals around the world. What type of gaols they score and how many chances it takes to score those goals.
