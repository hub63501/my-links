  <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2 b--blue">
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      “If you can keep your head when all about you
      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
      If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
      But make allowance for their doubting too;
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
      Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
      Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
      If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
      If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
      And treat those two impostors just the same;
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
      Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
      Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
      And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can make one heap of all your winnings
      And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
      And lose, and start again at your beginnings
      And never breathe a word about your loss;
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
      To serve your turn long after they are gone,
      And so hold on when there is nothing in you
      Except the will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
      Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
      If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
      If all men count with you, but none too much;
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">
      If you can fill the unforgiving minute
      With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
      Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
      And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!”
      </p>

      “Peace demands the most heroic labor and the most difficult sacrifice. It demands greater heroism than war. It
      demands greater fidelity to the truth and a much more perfect purity of conscience.”

      “I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic
      is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my
      faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat
      and death.”
