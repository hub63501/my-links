<h2>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</h2>

<h2>"Each life is made up of mistakes and learning, waiting and growing, practicing patience and being persistent." </h2>

<p>Billy Graham</p>
