<h2>{{site.description}}</h2>

This is a project I've been working on. If you're reading this, you are one of the few people seeing this page, so thank you for your time. I started developing this website back in 2017. I wanted to create a space to share interesting links that I discovered, hoping that others would find them valuable as well. However, it's been a while since I worked on it, and it has just been sitting there. I've been wanting to invest more time in developing the concept of sharing five links each day links worth reading. Five links worth reading, it isn't a new idea by any means.
