Here are five linux apps to try if your a linux user.

- <a href="https://hisham.hm/htop/" target="_blank">htop</a>: a good tool for analyzing network traffic.

- <a href="https://github.com/calo001/fondo" target="_blank">fondo</a>: Wallpapers for everyone. A program that
      looks great and makes your desktop look great.
    
- <a href="https://www.odio.io" target="_blank">
        Odio:</a> A really nice looking application that streams radio stations from around the world. If you've ever tried the
      mobile app Tunein then this is like the desktop version of that but in my view a whole lot better.
  
- <a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/#pk_campaign=sd&pk_kwd=features-en-gb" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>: a very
      underated web browser that keeps on getting better with each update. Also the mobile web browser is'nt bad either
      and is one browser that still ocupies the top tab function.

- <a href="https://laverna.cc" target="_blank">Laverna</a>: a clean looking note taking app with encryption enabled.
